# TODO

## Audience targeting

Write an intro for

- people interested in DNN
- developers new to DNN
- researchers with a jumpstart guide

## Android docs

Installation guide for adding to a project
- pre-complied .so files
- build instructions

## Installation

Simple install & test in under

- [ ] 10 minutes
- [ ] 5 minutes
- [ ] 1 minute
- [ ] 30 seconds (feasible?)

## Tutorials

1. test basic functionality & assure it works
2. matching demo (images)
3. simple training set demo (same images used in matching demo)
4. modify the training set
5. toy regression
6. MNIST
  * - [ ] TODO: write key points to observe in this tutorial.

## Misc

- [ ] fix terms
  * - [ ] model - the thing that you get after running the neural net that is used in detections/tests later
  * - [ ] experiments - differentiate building and messing with the network versus testing or running the network with live inputs
- [ ] add demo links
  * - [ ] caffe examples vs caffe2 examples
  * - [x] more highlights to cover a range of applications
- [ ] add graphic to the header
- [ ] obtain real website host for this content
  * - [ ] update any references
- [ ] swap out references to aaronmarkham repo on tutorials.md when the tutorials update hits the main repo
