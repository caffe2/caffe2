# Caffe2

Caffe2 is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is an experimental refactoring of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), and allows a more flexible way to organize computation. Caffe2 is currently written in Python 2 with support for Python 3 coming in the near future.
